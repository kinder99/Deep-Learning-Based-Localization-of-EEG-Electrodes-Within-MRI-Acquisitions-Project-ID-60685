# Deep Learning-Based Localization of EEG Electrodes Within MRI Acquisitions

## This repository follows Caroline Pinte's work, and builds upon it by :
- adjusting and testing the existing method on T1 images
- adding other stuff

## Recommendations
The use of a virtual environment with the following packages :
- nnUNet (mandatory)
- pytorch (mandatory)
- nibabel (mandatory)
- pandas (mandatory)
- hiddenlayer (recommended)
